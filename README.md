# Linear Algebra 10X Builder Series

> Learning Linear Algebra by building hands-on projects and practice tools inspired by Gilbert Strang’s *Introduction to Linear Algebra*.

---

## About

This repository chronicles my journey to **deeply learn Linear Algebra** by combining **hands-on projects** with **exploratory Jupyter notebooks**. I'm using code to prototype ideas, build visualizations, and internalize concepts from Gilbert Strang’s textbook.

Each project starts as a **CLI-based prototype**, which I will later evolve into a **full-stack application** to reinforce both mathematical understanding and software engineering skills.


---

## Goals

* Master key concepts in Linear Algebra through **projects and practice**
* Build **intuition** with hands-on coding and visual exploration
* Strengthen my foundation for **machine learning** and **applied math**
* Mix **polished builds** with fast experimentation to support active learning

### Practice Notebooks

The `practice/` folder is where I:

- Explore quick ideas (e.g., check if vectors are perpendicular)
- Visualize concepts like transformations or matrix operations
- Write utilities and test logic before using them in projects
- Build small demos that help reinforce what I’m studying

These are fast, experimental, and support the main project work. 

---

### Tools & Libraries

- **Python** — core language
- **Jupyter Notebooks** — fast experiments and visualization
- **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **SymPy** — computation + plotting
- Optional extras like Flask or React if I build UI-based tools
