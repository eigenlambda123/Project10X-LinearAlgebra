# Linear Algebra 10X

> Learning Linear Algebra by building hands-on projects and practice tools inspired by Gilbert Strang’s *Introduction to Linear Algebra*.


---


## About

This repository chronicles my journey to **deeply learn Linear Algebra** by combining **hands-on projects** with **exploratory Jupyter notebooks**. I'm using code to prototype ideas, build visualizations, and internalize concepts from Gilbert Strang’s textbook.

Each project starts as a **CLI-based prototype**, which I will later evolve into a **full-stack application** to reinforce both mathematical understanding and software engineering skills.


---

## Goals

* Master key concepts in Linear Algebra through **projects and practice**
* Build **intuition** with hands-on coding and visual exploration
* Strengthen my foundation for **machine learning** and **applied math**
* Mix **polished builds** with fast experimentation to support active learning

### Practice Notebooks

The `practice/` folder is where I:

- Explore quick ideas
- Visualize concepts like transformations or matrix operations
- Write utilities and test logic before using them in projects
- Build small demos that help reinforce what I’m studying

These are fast, experimental, and support the main project work.

### Tools & Libraries

- **Python** 
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **SymPy**
- (Planned) Web tech like **Flask** or **React** for UI-based tools
