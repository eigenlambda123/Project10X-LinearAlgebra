# Linear Algebra 10X Builder Series

> Learning Linear Algebra by building hands-on projects and practice tools inspired by Gilbert Strang’s *Introduction to Linear Algebra*.

---

## About

This repo documents my journey to **deeply learn Linear Algebra** through code. I’m combining **practical projects** with **exploratory notebooks** to prototype ideas, experiment with visualizations, and truly understand the concepts from Strang’s book.

It extends the same learning philosophy I use in my [Project10X – The Backend Builder Series](https://github.com/eigenlambda123/Project10X-The-Backend-Builder-Series.git), now applied to math (Linear Algebra).

---

## Goals

* Master key concepts in Linear Algebra through **projects and practice**
* Build **intuition** with hands-on coding and visual exploration
* Strengthen my foundation for **machine learning, computer graphics**, and **applied math**
* Mix **polished builds** with fast experimentation to support active learning

## 🔬 Practice Notebooks

The `practice/` folder is where I:

- Explore quick ideas (e.g., check if vectors are perpendicular)
    
- Visualize concepts like transformations or matrix operations
    
- Write utilities and test logic before using them in projects
    
- Build small demos that help reinforce what I’m studying
    

These are fast, experimental, and support the main project work.

## How I Use This Repo

1. Pick a **project or topic** I’m studying from Strang’s book
    
2. Read and work through the relevant textbook sections
    
3. Use **practice notebooks** to test, play, and explore
    
4. Build or iterate on a **project** to apply what I’ve learned
    
5. Create visuals or stretch features to push understanding further

## Tools & Libraries

- **Python** — core language
    
- **Jupyter Notebooks** — fast experiments and visualization
    
- **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **SymPy (optional)** — computation + plotting
    
- Optional extras like Flask or React if I build UI-based tools
